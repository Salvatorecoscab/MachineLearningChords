<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

When a person starts learning how to play guitar, they ofteh start learning some chords. That is why I decided to create a machine lerning model that from a video, an image or just using the webcam, it can recognize the chords that are being played. 
I have already trained the model with 11 different chords, and I am planning to add more chords in the future. The chords that the model can recognize are: A, Am, Bm, B7, C, D, D7, Dm, Em, F, and G.
This chord detection application might be useful in the future to develop more complex applications, such as a guitar teacher.
This is a project that I am doing for my Machine Learning lecture at Hof University of Applied Sciences.
If you want to see the images that I used to train the model, you can find them in the next links:
* [dataset with augmnentation](https://app.roboflow.com/school-sps5k/chorddetection2.2/1)
* [dataset without augmentation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bDZHMe4fbbrXj0HvlKFn1YTyW3PKdSHg?usp=drive_link)

If you want to see the explanation of the code for the application or how I trained the model, you can find it in the following links:
* [Code for aplication](CODE.md)
* [Code for training the model](TRAIN.md)

### Built With

This model was built using mostly Python, Roboflow, YOLOv8, OpenCV, and PyTorch.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

If you want use one of the two models that I have already trained for the application that recognizes the chords you can follow the instructions below.

<!-- add link -->
### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8 or higher
* OpenCV
* YOLO
* Download one of the models from the following links:
    * [Version 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UH5IGShcNTGRWJmEr_HkUWbeh4Hg4eXh/view?usp=drive_link)
    * [Version 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dkf01HCFlMJX_NJqrYd8zBbyCNi5ZZN8/view?usp=drive_link)


### Installation

You just have to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. 
```sh
git clone
pip install opencv-python
pip install ultralytics
```
once the dependencies are installed, you just have to download one of the models from the links above and put it in the same folder as the ChordDetection.py file.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To start the chord detection application, once you have cloned the repository and installed the necessary dependencies, you just have to run the following in the terminal:
```sh
python ChordDetection.py
```
This will open the webcam and start detecting the chords that the camera can see. If you want to use a video, you can use the following command:
```sh
python ChordDetection.py --source "path to the video or image"
```




<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] detect chords from webcam and video
- [ ] Add more chords to the model
- [ ] Train a new model with more chords
- [ ] Create a GUI for the application
